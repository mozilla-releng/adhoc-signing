# Release Engineering docs

This document is for Release Engineering, on how to maintain this repo, and how to deal with ad-hoc signing requests.

1. Find out what needs signing, and why
   1. Make sure the signing format is a [supported signing format](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/adhoc-signing/search?q=supported_signing_formats&unscoped_q=supported_signing_formats). (These are currently both Firefox Release and Firefox Nightly cert formats.)
   2. Make sure this is a valid request. (e.g. check the requester identity on PMO, ensure the binary is related to the requester organization, etc)
2. Get the binary to sign. This can be via bug attachment, taskcluster artifact link, magic wormhole
3. Calculate the checksum and the filesize:
   ```
   openssl sha256 <filename>
   cat <filename> | wc -c
   ```
4. Create a pull request, adding a new signing manifest to the [signing manifest directory](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/adhoc-signing/tree/master/signing-manifests). Use the [template](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/adhoc-signing/blob/master/signing-manifests/example.yml.tmpl) and create a new `.yml` file.
5. Get review, and merge.
6. Promote your manifest to get a valid release signature. Someday these steps will be in shipit, but for now:
   - Go to the merge taskgroup. Generally this is linked from the status symbol of the latest merge to master: a yellow dot for in-progress, a red X for failure, and a ![green checkmark](screenshot1.png) for success. Click it.
   - Click on `details` of the decision task, then `View task in taskcluster` to go to the decision task. This task will need to be green before we can proceed.
   - Go to the task group view: Either click on `Task Group` at the top left, or change the `tasks/TASKID` to `tasks/groups/TASKID` in the url bar.
   - Click the vertical three dots in the lower right, and choose `Promote an adhoc signature`. You will need to be signed in for this to work. The sign-in link is in the top right.
   - In the `Promote an adhoc signature` page, fill in the `adhoc_name`. This will match the name of the new signing manifest, minus the trailing `.yml`. So if you just added `bug12345.yml` for this signing request, your `adhoc_name` would be `bug12345`.
   - Click `Promote an Adhoc Signature` in the bottom right. This will spawn an action task. Once it goes green, go to the action task group by changing the url from `tasks/TASKID` to `tasks/groups/TASKID`. (The `Task Group` link in the top left will bring you to the *decision task group*, not the *action task group*.) The `release-signing` task will have the signed artifact.
